Welcome to the OpenMandriva stand
OpenMandriva: What is it? What started it? OpenMandriva Lx is an rpm based linux distribution with its roots in Gael Duvals Mandrake distribution which eventually became Mandriva. When Mandriva closed, the OpenMandriva Association was formed as a charitable body charged with continuing the work of Mandrake/Mandriva in the open source arena. We have continued to produce new releases of OpenMandriva since 2013.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://fosdem-stands-website.carreira.pw/stands/openmandriva/helpful-tips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fosdem-stands-website.carreira.pw/stands/openmandriva/helpful-tips/</guid><description>Helpful tips for those new to OM Lx or Linux OpenMandriva is designed to be a unique and independent Community distribution of Linux and direct descendant of Mandriva Linux.
